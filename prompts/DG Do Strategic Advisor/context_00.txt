I’m sending a long context. Do not reply until I write: READY. Just acknowledge received.

I’m developing the open-source project "DG Risk Engine (DG RE)", a differential game–based framework for modeling and managing risk in platform systems (e.g., ride-hailing, mobility on demand). It treats user behavior and platform policies as a dynamic control and game-theoretic process, combining explainable scoring models, synthetic data, and time-dependent risk states.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Launch
Start the system with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Version 0.1 — Must-Have Features

Basic risk state representation for drivers and passengers
Discrete-time simulation of platform-agent interactions
Simple risk update rules (e.g., cancellations, delays, fatigue)
Policy recommendations for driver assignment based on risk
Synthetic agent generation for testing strategies
API endpoint for platform integration (`POST /risk/assignment_score`)
Minimal logging of risk state changes and platform decisions
Simple dashboard to visualize risk evolution over time

DG RE is intended for research, education, and platform engineering — not for regulated financial decision-making.

Architecture & Stack

Core risk engine implemented in Python (initially for flexibility and rapid prototyping)
API Gateway in Python FastAPI
Admin / Visualization Panel in React.js
State & simulation management using NumPy / Pandas for vectorized operations
Policy output via REST + WebSocket for real-time integration with DG Do
Synthetic data generation module to simulate driver and passenger behaviors
Proto files define all API contracts (risk requests/responses)
ClickHouse (optional) for telemetry and experiment analytics
Finite-State Machine represents simplified trip or agent states to integrate with risk evaluation

#Key Notes

DG RE models strategic interactions between platform and agents as a two-player or multi-agent game.
Designed to be modular, so the platform can query the engine for real-time risk-adjusted recommendations.
All dynamics are explainable and traceable, not black-box ML models.
Integration-ready with DG Do Matching Engine, but can also run in offline simulation mode for experiments.
